# Algorithms

## Algorithm

  - written at design time
  - Domain knowledge
  - can use any language
  - H/W and OS independent
  - can be analyzed

## Program

  - Implementation time
  - programmer ( can also have domain knowledge)
  - written only in a programming language
  - H/W & OS dependent
  - Testing

## Prior Analysis vs Posteriori Testing

### Priori Analysis (done on algorithms)

1. Algorithm
2. Independent of Language
3. hardware Independent
4. Time and Space Function

### Posteriori Testing (done on programs)

1. Program
2. Language dependent
3. Hardware dependent
4. watch time & bytes

## Characteristics of Algorithm

1. Input - 0 or more
2. Output - 1 or more
3. Definiteness - clear statements 
4. Finiteness - stops at some point
5. Effectiveness - should serve some purpose (avoid unnecessary statements)
